## Composition > Inheritance 


- Code reuse w/ inheritance
- Code reuse w/ composition

Problems with inheritance: 
- easily abused by amateur developers
- large hierachies
- fragile due to tight coupling (butterfly effect)


***Any inheritance relationship can be translated to Composition***

Benefits of Composition:
- Great flexibility
- Eventually loose coupling


***Summary***
2 types of relationships between classes:
- Inhreitance (Is-a)
  - Pros: Code re-use, easier to understand
  - Cons: Tightly coupled, fragile, can be abused
- Composition (has-a)
  - Pros: Code re-use, great flexibility, loose coupling
  - Cons: harder to understand
